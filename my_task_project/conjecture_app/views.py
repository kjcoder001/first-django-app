    collatz_conjec="""In mathematics, a conjecture is a conclusion or proposition based on incomplete information,
    for which no proof has been found.
    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows:
    start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous
    term is even, the next term is one half the previous term. Otherwise, the next term is 3
    times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.
    Paul Erd≈ës said about the Collatz conjecture: 'Mathematics may not be ready for such problems.'
    He also offered $500 for its solution. Jeffrey Lagarias in 2010 claimed that based only on known
    information about this problem, 'this is an extraordinarily difficult problem, completely out of
    reach of present day mathematics.'"""
